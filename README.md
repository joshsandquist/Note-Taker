# Express Note Taker

  

  ## Description
  This project is a code refactor project. The application started with a completed front end and needed me to create a back end server and connect it to the front. I was required to use ExpressJS in order to complete the app's functionallity. The application itself can be used to save notes that a user inputs, as well as delete them
